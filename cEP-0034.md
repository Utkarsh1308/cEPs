## Abstract

This cEP describes the implementation of binary diffs and xml diffs which
will allow coala to generate nested diffs for XML files and binary diffs for
handling binary formats and demonstrates their use on a bear which
would use the new diff functionality.

The cEP also discusses approaches for improving existing diff handling by adding
context for diffs and improving FileFactory.

## Introduction

Currently coala supports unified diff handling which produces a smaller diff
with old and new text presented immediately adjacent. It creates line by line
diffs which are suited towards text files. The diffs only show the line of the
code for which the diff is shown with no context as to which function the code
belongs to. Showing some context would help the users in finding the code
easily.

Git gives the function definition using `git show` in which it is easier to
understand what the code does because git gives information regarding what
function it resides in even though the function definition would normally not
be in the diff. This project implements a similar behavior in our coala output.

Bears can handle binary files by setting `USE_RAW_FILES` to True. However these
bears will have to be in charge of managing the file (opening the file, closing
the file, reading the file, etc). There is not a binary diff handling system
set in place whose functionality the bears could use to handle binary files
automatically.

There are currently no bears for handling binary formats. This project would
enable coala to handle binary files and add a bear which uses the new binary
diffing system. We will use the [multidiff](https://github.com/juhakivekas/multidiff)
library for generating the binary diffs.

For generating nested diffs for XML files we will use the [xmldiff](
https://github.com/Shoobx/xmldiff) library.

Currently coala only supports utf-8 encoded files. This project would add
support for handling non utf-8 text files (utf16/32, latin1 etc.).

## Fileproxy

coala doesn't have support for handling files with encodings other than UTF-8
(UTF-16/UTF-32/latin-1). The File Class responsible for decoding files only
decodes files with encoding UTF-8 which raises a __UnicodeDecodeError__ when
trying to decode files with different encodings.

This can be fixed by using the [detect_encoding](
https://gitlab.com/coala/coala-utils/blob/master/coala_utils/FileUtils.py#L18)
method from coala_utils.

The string method in File class needs to be changed:

![string](https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/file.png)

When detect_encoding is run on utf-32 files it returns encoding as utf-16
instead of utf-32. This is because byte order markers (for Little Endian) for
utf-16 is b'\xff\xfe' and for utf-32 is b'\xff\xfe\x00\x00' and for utf-32
encoded files detect_encoding reads the first 4 chars which are
b'\xff\xfe\x00\x00'.

running `raw.startswith()` would give a match for both UTF-16 and UTF-32 BOMS
and the code would exit after matching UTF-16. The same case is for Big Endian
arrangement.

Hence detect_encoding incorrectly recognizes utf-32 files as utf-16

This can be fixed by the patch shown below

```python
def detect_encoding(filename, default='utf-8'):
    with open(filename, 'rb') as f:
        raw = f.read(4)  # will read less if the file is smaller

    for enc, boms in [
        ('utf-8-sig', (codecs.BOM_UTF8,)),
        ('utf-16', (codecs.BOM_UTF16_LE, codecs.BOM_UTF16_BE)),
        ('utf-32', (codecs.BOM_UTF32_LE, codecs.BOM_UTF32_BE))
    ]:
        if any(raw.startswith(bom) for bom in boms):
            if enc == 'utf-16' and raw in (codecs.BOM_UTF32_LE,
                                           codecs.BOM_UTF32_BE):
                return 'utf-32'
            return enc

    return default

```

This will be followed by writing cli tests for coala and adding support for
non utf-8 encodings to coala_utils and write tests.

### Problems found

SpellCheckBear uses an external linter program scspell which likely only
supports utf-8 and it doesn't return a patch when coala gives it a utf-16 file.

Some other bears might also give the same error which could be problematic.

To fix this a possible approach could be that the bears give the encoding they
can handle and coala needs to determine whether lossless encoding is possible
and create a temporary file in the linter's accepted encoding (converting
utf-16 to utf-8 in this case).

## Context for diffs

This is a sample output by using PEP8 Bear on a python file

![sample_output](https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/sample_output.png)

The diffs only show the affected line of the code with no context as to which
function the code belongs to.

There are 2 types of context which can be added - extra lines before
and after the line, and info about parents in the syntax tree (i.e class and
function name)

For the first type of context, we determine the context by checking the
indentation and printing all lines that have a lower indentation than the last
printed one

The following approach would be used to achieve this:

* Get the line number and filename of the diff from sourcerange.
* Get to the line number of diff.
* Loop backward and compare the indentation of nth line with (n-1)th line, if
equal, do nothing, if lesser, then print that line with its line number. Break
out of the loop when there is a line that matches r`\n\S.*`

The function `get_context` and `print_before_context` to get the context and
print the context respectively would be written in `ConsoleInteraction.py` and
are shown below

```python
def get_context(file_dict,
                sourcerange):
    """
    Gets context for the affected lines and also the line numbers
    of the context
    :param file_dict:       A dictionary containing all files as values with
                            filenames as key.
    :param sourcerange:     The SourceRange object referring to the related
                            lines to print.
    :return:                Affected file's contextual information.
    """

    related_lines = list()
    related_lines_number = list()

    affected_line = file_dict[sourcerange.file][
                    sourcerange.start.line-1].rstrip().replace('\t', 8*' ')

    indent_space_count = len(affected_line)-len(affected_line.lstrip())
    if indent_space_count > 0:
        for line in range(sourcerange.start.line-2, -1, -1):  # pragma: no cover

                    line].rstrip().replace('\t', 8*' ')
            previous_space_count = len(rline) - len(rline.lstrip())
            if previous_space_count < indent_space_count and rline:
                related_lines.append(rline)
                related_lines_number.append(line+1)
                indent_space_count = previous_space_count
            if indent_space_count == 0:
                break
    else:
        pre_context = list(range(sourcerange.start.line-2, -1, -1))
        pre_context = pre_context[0: min(2, len(pre_context))]
        for line in pre_context:
            related_lines.append(file_dict[sourcerange.file][line])
            related_lines_number.append(line+1)

    related_lines_number.reverse()
    related_lines.reverse()

    return related_lines, related_lines_number

def print_before_context(console_printer,
                         file_dict,
                         sourcerange):  # pragma: no cover

        # object.
        printed_chars = 0
        if line == sourcerange.start.line and sourcerange.start.column:
            console_printer.print(highlight_text(
                no_color, line[:sourcerange.start.column - 1],
                BackgroundMessageStyle, lexer), end='')

            printed_chars = sourcerange.start.column - 1

        if line == sourcerange.end.line and sourcerange.end.column:
            console_printer.print(highlight_text(
                no_color, line[printed_chars:sourcerange.end.column - 1],
                BackgroundSourceRangeStyle, lexer), end='')

            console_printer.print(highlight_text(
               no_color, line[sourcerange.end.column - 1:],
               BackgroundSourceRangeStyle, lexer), end='')
            console_printer.print('')
        else:
            console_printer.print(highlight_text(
                no_color, line[printed_chars:], BackgroundMessageStyle, lexer),
                                  end='')
            console_printer.print('')

```

The output will print the lines before the code. It will look like this:

![first_context](https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/first_context.png)

After implementing this we can improve the diffs to show parents as headers and
print the extra lines of context before and after the affected line. A data
structure can be added which stores the parent keywords.

The new type of context when run on a [sample file](
https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/context/main.c)
will give the following diff output:

![context_1](https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/context_1.png)
![context_2](https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/context_2.png)

![context_5](https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/context_5.png)
![context_6](https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/context_6.png)
![context_7](https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/context_7.png)

## Binary Diffs

A binary file is defined by the absence of an end-of-line marker. For a binary
diff, there are no lines, hence we can’t use our existing unified diff system
for diffing binary files.

To show a binary diff, the UI needs to show byte-ranges of changes, using some
textual encoding of the bytes (e.g. hex) with some extra bytes each side to
help the user see where those bytes are. This can then be made more
user-friendly by describing the change to the user with text and then do the
binary change if accepted.

I will be testing the new binary diff system on binary formats like JPEG and
PNG Files.

The following process would be followed to generate binary diffs:

* Open the original file and the fixed file.
* Iterate through both files from the start to the end - this gives us an
address (offset) in the file (byte 0, byte 1, byte 2, etc)
* compare the bytes at the current position, and if they are not the same,
print the address and the two different bytes

To generate a binary diff, classes like SourceRange, etc are all problematic.
They all assume there is a end-of-line separator

Currently coala has the option to run raw files. Processing allows raw files if
the Bear states that it uses raw files. If this is enabled, bears are in charge
of doing the file handling (opening it, closing it, reading it, etc). Bears that
use binary files can't be mixed with Bears that use text files.

Bears which handle binary files are required to set USE_RAW_FILES=TRUE - coalib
has code for this, but we have no bears which use this yet

Currently There are already some PRs for binary bears -

* [ImageCompressionBear](https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/1302)
* [ImageDimensionBear](https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/1288)
* [MP3CheckBear](https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/1543)

Below is the hexdump of the 2 sample binary files - bin_file1 and bin_file2

![bin_file1](
https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/bin_file1.png)

![bin_file2](
https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/bin_file2.png)

On running these 2 files with a binary diffing library
[multidiff](https://github.com/juhakivekas/multidiff) we get the following
output:

![original_binary_diff](https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/original_binary_diff.png)

The library can be trained to get the following output:

![trained_binary_diff](https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/trained_binary_diff.png)

The binary diff shows:

* The address/offset where the byte changes have occured
* The bytes preceding and succeeding the changed byte range (context)
* The operation performed - (`<delete>`, `<insert>`, `<replace>`)

The ascii row (3rd column in the original diff output) was removed for better
looking diffs but can be added again if we need a different design.

[ImageCompressionBear](https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/1302) is a
bear which uses the optimage library to check if an image can be compressed and
calculates the number of bytes which would be reduced if it is compressed.

A sample mockup for the bear is given below -

```python

                                     file=filename)

        os.remove(output_filename)
```

For using the bear with the new binary diff handling system a possible approach
is listed below:

* Run the bear with the image file which you want compressed
* The bear will check if the image can be compressed, If it can, the bear will
generate a binary diff with the changes to the byte range.
* The user can then choose from the actions provided.

### Modifying ImageCompressionBear

* First we would need to create a new function `binary_diff()` in `Diff.py`
which will generate the binary diff and store it in a class variable
`self.binary` and call it in ImageCompressionBear.

* travis runs Ubuntu 16.04 which does not install zopflipng on running
apt-get zopfli (zopflipng gets installed in Ubuntu 18.04). So for now we
can't run tests for PNG files in travis.

We will make use of the multidiff library to generate the binary diff.
The binary diff would be stored as a string which would be iterated over
to get the desired binary diff output in ShowPatchAction.

### Changes in coala core

For `bool(Diff[])` to return True (needed for ShowPatchAction to print the
binary diffs), we can set a rename attribute for the Diff Class or we can
also modify the `Diff.modified()` method to achieve the same goal.

We also need to add an additional parameter `additional_info` to SourceRange
and Result class and set it to `binary` when we are printing binary diffs.

There are lots of changes in binary code when we modify a binary file. So it
would not be feasible to print the affected lines. Hence we only call the
`print_lines()` method in `ConsoleInteraction.py` when additional_info is not
set to `binary`.

Then we need to create a new function `print_binary_diff` in ShowPatchAction.py
which will print the binary diff.

The following files need to be changed:

Diff.py
```python
  def binary_diff(self, filename, output_filename):
      """
      Generates a binary diff corresponding to this patch.

      The diff will display the byte addresses where the bytes are modified.
      """

      self.binary = main([filename, output_filename, '--diff',
                          '--html'])
      self.output = list(output_filename)

  @property
  def modified(self):
      """
      Calculates the modified file, after applying the Diff to the original.

      This property also adds linebreaks at the end of each line.
      If no newline was present at the end of file before, this state will
      be preserved, except if the last line is deleted.
      """
      if self.binary:
          return self._generate_linebreaks(self.output)
      return self._generate_linebreaks(self._raw_modified())  
```

ShowPatchAction.py
```python
def print_binary_diff(difflines, filename, to_filename, printer):
    printer.print(format_line(filename, real_nr='------'), color='red')
    printer.print(format_line(to_filename, real_nr='++++++'), color='freen')

    addresses = re.findall(r'[\w]{6}:', difflines)
    bytes = re.split(r'[\w]{6}:', difflines)

## XML Diff

This approach describes an XML patch framework that utilizes the [xmldiff](
https://github.com/Shoobx/xmldiff) library to generate XML Diffs.

The library follows the following paper to generate XML Diffs -
[Change Detection in Hierarchically Structured Information](
http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/115/1/1995-46.pdf)

The [xmldiff](https://github.com/Shoobx/xmldiff) library has functionality for
creating diffs for XML documents and also applying patches to them.

The following XPath data model node types can be added, replaced, or removed
with this framework: elements, attributes, namespaces, comments, texts, and
processing instructions.

A sample mockup for the xmldiff is given below:

![patching-process](
https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/xmldiff.png)

The library also has an xml outformat which gives a nested xml diff which we
would make use of in generating our diffs.

![outformat_xml](
https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/outformat_xml.png)

### Note

Currently we have one bear for xml files XmlBear which is a linter bear which
uses xmllint to lint xml files. The xml diffs we generate are for
additions/deletions/editing in nodes and don't detect changes in formatting but
actual changes in data.

### Approach

For getting xml diffs we would need to create a new method
`process_output_xml_diff()`in linter.py. Which would call a Diff method
`from_xml_diff()` which would generate the xml diffs. Then we need to create a
new method `print_xml_diff()`in ShowPatchAction to print the xml diffs.

Fortunately unlike binary diffs we won't have problems with SourceRange and
File Handling so we don't need to modify them like we did in binary diffs.

Some things need to be taken into account while coming up with the design
for XML Diffs:

* The xml diffs print an xml string which would generally be more than
the DIFF_EXCERPT_MAX_SIZE so we need to decide if we just need to show
the stats (number of changes) to the user and print the xml diff only
when the user selects the ShowAppliedPatches action.

* We can still use the Diff operations for adding/deleting/replacing a line
so that we don't need additional methods for xml diffs. We would print the
whole xml diff which would include all the changes at once, so we need to think
about how to show the context for the affected lines or whether to remove the
context altogether.

* xml files could be 200-300 lines long (or more!). As a result the xml diff
printed would be very long and we need to decide whether we just want to print
the list of patch operations in that case.

The following files need to be changed to add support for XML Diffs:


Diff.py
```python
def from_xml_diff(self, new_file, original_file):

      original_content = "".join(original_file)
      if isinstance(new_file, str):
          new_file = "".join(new_file.splitlines(keepends=True))
      new_content = "".join(new_file)

      formatter = formatting.XMLFormatter(normalize=formatting.WS_BOTH,
                                          pretty_print=True)

      self.xml = main.diff_texts(original_content,
                                 new_content,
                                 formatter=formatter)
```

ShowPatchAction.py
```python
def print_xml_diff(difflines, diff, printer):
    current_line_added = None
    current_line_subtracted = None
    for line in difflines:
        if line.startswith('@@'):
            values = line[line.find('-'):line.rfind(' ')]
            subtracted, added = tuple(values.split(' '))
            current_line_added = int(added.split(',')[0][1:])
            current_line_subtracted = int(subtracted.split(',')[0][1:])
        elif line.startswith('---'):
            print_from_name(printer, line[4:])
        elif line.startswith('+++'):
            print_to_name(printer, line[4:])
    print(diff.xml.rstrip())
```

### Versions of XML Diffs we can print

The xmldiff library has 2 possible diff outputs

* The diff output as xml  

```
<data xmlns:diff="http://namespaces.shoobx.com/diff">
  <country name="Liechtenstein">
    <rank>1</rank>
    <year>2008</year>
    <gdppc>141100</gdppc>
    <neighbor name="ert4773" direction="E" diff:update-attr="name:happy"/>
    <neighbor name="Switzerland" direction="W"/>
  </country>
</data>
```

* The diff output as a list of patch operations

```
[update-attribute, /data/country/neighbor[1], name, "ert4773"]
```
