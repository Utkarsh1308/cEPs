## Abstract

This cEP describes the implementation of binary diffs and xml diffs which
will allow coala to generate nested diffs for XML files and binary diffs for
handling binary formats and demonstrates their use by creating a bear which
would use the new diff functionality.

The cEP also discusses approaches for improving existing diff handling by adding
context for diffs and improving FileFactory.

## Introduction

Currently coala supports unified diff handling which produces a smaller diff
with old and new text presented immediately adjacent. It creates line by line
diffs which are suited towards text files.

Currently the diffs only show the line of the code for which the diff is shown
with no context as to which function the code belongs to. Showing some context
would help the users in finding the code easily.

Git gives the function definition using `git show` in which it is easier to
understand what the code does because git gives information regarding what
function it resides in even though the function definition would normally not be
in the diff. This project implements a similar behavior in our coala output.

Bears can handle binary files by setting `USE_RAW_FILES` to True. However these
bears will have to be in charge of managing the file (opening the file, closing
the file, reading the file, etc). There is not a binary diff handling system
set in place whose functionality the bears could use to handle binary files
automatically.

There are currently no bears for handling binary formats. This project would
enable coala to handle binary files and add a bear which uses the new binary
diffing system.

This project also describes an XML patch framework that utilizes XMLPath
Language (XPath) selectors. An XPath selector is used to pinpoint the specific
portion of the XML that is the target for the change.

If time permits and optional task could be adding support for FileFactory to
handle non utf-8 text files (utf16/32, latin1 etc.) and support non Unix EOLs.

## Fileproxy

coala doesn't have support for handling files with encoding other than UTF-8
(UTF-16/UTF-32/latin-1). The File Class responsible for decoding files only
decodes files with encoding UTF-8 which raises a __UnicodeDecodeError__ when
trying to decode files with different encodings.

This can be fixed by using the [detect_encoding](
https://gitlab.com/coala/coala-utils/blob/master/coala_utils/FileUtils.py#L18)
method from coala_utils.

The string method in File class needs to be changed:

![string](https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/file.png)

This will be followed by writing tests for coala and coala_utils and then
fix the files where the tests fail while handling non utf-8 encoded files.

## Context for diffs

This is a sample output by using PEP8 Bear on a python file

![sample_output](https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/sample_output.png)

The diffs only show the line of the code with no context as to which function
the code belongs to

There are 2 types of context which can be added - extra lines before
and after the line, and info about parents in the syntax tree (i.e class and
function name)

For the first type of context, I would determine the context by checking the
indentation and printing all lines that have a lower indentation than the last
printed one

The following approach would be used:

* Get the line number and filename of the diff from sourcerange.
* Get to the line number of diff.
* Loop backward and compare the indentation of nth line with (n-1)th line, if
equal, do nothing, if lesser, then print that line with its line number. Break
out of the loop when there is a line that matches r`\n\S.*`

The function `get_context` to get the context would be written in
`ConsoleInteraction.py` is given below

```python
def get_context(file_dict,
                sourcerange):
    """
    Processes the affected line and the file to find the context for those
    lines.
    :param file_dict:             A dictionary containing all files as values with
                                  filenames as key.
    :param sourcerange:           The SourceRange object referring to the related
                                  lines to print.
    :return:                      Returns affected_line's contextual information
    """
    related_lines = list()
    related_line_nr = list()

    affected_line = file_dict[sourcerange.file][
        sourcerange.start.line - 1].rstrip()
    affected_line = affected_line.replace('\t', 8*' ')
    indent_space_count = len(affected_line) - len(affected_line.lstrip())

    if indent_space_count > 0:
        for j in range(sourcerange.start.line-2, -1, -1):    # pragma: no branch
            rline = file_dict[sourcerange.file][j].rstrip()
            affected_line = affected_line.replace('\t', 8*' ')
            prv_space_count = len(rline) - len(rline.lstrip())
            if prv_space_count < indent_space_count and rline:
                related_lines.append(rline)
                related_line_nr.append(j+1)
                indent_space_count = prv_space_count
            if indent_space_count == 0:
                break
    else:
        pre_context = list(range(sourcerange.start.line-1))
        pre_context.reverse()
        pre_context = pre_context[0: min(2, len(pre_context))]
        for i in pre_context:
            related_lines.append(file_dict[sourcerange.file][i])
            related_line_nr.append(i+1)

    return related_lines, related_line_nr
```

The output will print the lines before the code. It will look like this:

![first_context](https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/first_context.png)

After implementing this we can improve the diffs to show parents as headers and
extra lines of context before and after the affected line. A data structure can
be added which stores the parent keywords.

The new type of context when run on a [sample file](
https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/context/main.c)
will give the following diff output:

![context_1](https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/context_1.png)
![context_2](https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/context_2.png)
![context_3](https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/context_3.png)
![context_4](https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/context_4.png)
![context_5](https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/context_5.png)
![context_6](https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/context_6.png)
![context_7](https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/context_7.png)

## Binary Diffs

A binary file is defined by the absence of an end-of-line marker. For a binary
diff, there are no lines, hence we canâ€™t use our existing unified diff system
for diffing binary files.

To show a binary diff, the UI needs to show byte-ranges of changes, using some
textual encoding of the bytes (e.g. hex) with some extra bytes each side to
help the user see where those bytes are. This can then be made more
user-friendly by describing the change to the user with text and then do the
binary change if accepted.

To generate a binary diff, classes like SourceRange, etc are all problematic.
They all assume there is a end-of-line separator

I will be testing the new binary diff system on binary formats like JPEG and
PNG Files.

The following process would be followed to generate binary diffs:

* Open the original file and the fixed file.
* Iterate through both files from the start to the end - this gives us an
address (offset) in the file (byte 0, byte 1, byte 2, etc)
* compare the bytes at the current position, and if they are not the same,
print the address and the two different bytes

Currently coala has the option to run raw files. Processing allows raw files if
the Bear states that it uses raw files. If this is enabled, bears are in charge
of doing the file handling (opening it, closing it, reading it, etc). Bears that
use binary files can't be mixed with Bears that use text files.

Bears which handle binary files are required to set USE_RAW_FILES=TRUE - coalib
has code for this, but we have no bears which use this yet

Currently There are already some PRs for binary bears -

* [ImageCompressionBear](https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/1302)
* [ImageDimensionBear](https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/1288)
* [MP3CheckBear](https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/1543)

Below is the hexdump of the 2 sample binary files - bin_file1 and bin_file2

![bin_file1](
https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/bin_file1.png)

![bin_file2](
https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/bin_file2.png)

On running these 2 files with a binary diffing library
[multidiff](https://github.com/juhakivekas/multidiff) we get the following
output:

![original_binary_diff](https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/original_binary_diff.png)

The library can be trained to get the following output:

![trained_binary_diff](https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/trained_binary_diff.png)

The binary diff shows:

* The address/offset where the byte changes have occured
* The bytes preceding and succeeding the changed byte range (context)
* The operation performed - (`<delete>`, `<insert>`, `<replace>`)

The ascii row (3rd column in the original diff output) was removed for better
looking diffs but can be added again if we need a different design.

[ImageCompressionBear](https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/1302) is a
bear which uses the optimage library to check if an image can be compressed and
calculates the number of bytes which would be reduced if it is compressed.

A sample mockup for the bear is given below -

```python

        os.remove(output_filename)
```

For using the bear with the new binary diff handling system a possible approach
is listed below:

* Run the bear with the image file which you want compressed
* The bear will check if the image can be compressed, If it can, the bear will
generate a binary diff with the changes to the byte range.
* The user can then choose from the actions provided.

## XML Diff

This approach describes an XML patch framework that utilizes the [xmldiff](
https://github.com/Shoobx/xmldiff) library to generate XML Diffs.

The library follows the following paper to generate XML Diffs -
[Change Detection in Hierarchically Structured Information](
http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/115/1/1995-46.pdf)

The [xmldiff](https://github.com/Shoobx/xmldiff) library has functionality for
creating diffs for XML documents and also applying patches to them.

The following XPath data model node types can be added, replaced, or removed
with this framework: elements, attributes, namespaces, comments, texts, and
processing instructions.

A sample mockup for the xmldiff is given below:

![patching-process](
https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/photos/xmldiff.png)

For generating the XML Diffs 2 methods will have to be written in the Diff Class:

* __xml_diff()__ method to generate an xml_diff corresponding to this patch
* A Classmethod __from_xml_diff__ which would create a Diff Object

After adding support for the new xmldiff I would write a new bear which would
make use of the new XML Diffs

We could test the new XML Diff Handling to XMLBear which currently uses
unified Diff Handling to generate diffs.
